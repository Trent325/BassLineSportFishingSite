            <Card.Title>Captain Willy</Card.Title>
            <Card.Text>
              Willy's deep passion for fishing developed at a young age while
              fishing with his father at the Jersey shore. When he was 14 years
              old, Willy got his first job working as a mate. Since then, he has
              been fishing up and down the Jersey Coast. When Willy turned 18,
              he obtained his OUPV Captains license and began his journey
              captaining boats. Willy is a well rounded fisherman and enjoys
              targeting striped bass from the rivers to the ocean, as well as
              tuna both inshore and in the canyons. He also enjoys wreck fishing
              for bottom fish and tile fishing in the canyons. Willy's true
              passion is providing people with memorable days on the water, as
              he enjoys taking people fishing and growing the sport. Willy has
              fished in numerous tournaments along the East Coast such as the
              "White Marlin Open" and the "Jimmy Johnson's Quest for the Ring."
              In 2022, he took home first place in the small boat division as a
              mate on team End Game. Nowadays, Willy captains the charter boat
              "Basslines" with his father, Bill Abbott. Together they make a
              great team fishing inshore and offshore out of New Jersey while
              targeting many different species.

            <Card.Text>
              Captain Bill has been fishing this area since he was a kid, so he
              knows the location of all the best fishing spots along the coast
              of New Jersey. With that map memorized, you could almost say he
              doesnâ€™t need GPS. Bill has an enormous amount of fishing wisdom
              under his belt and a passion for sharing it. From teaching the
              youngers how to cast, to helping anglers secure every fish they
              hook, Bill can and will do it all while smiling ear to ear.
