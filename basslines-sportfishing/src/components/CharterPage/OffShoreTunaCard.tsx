            Canyon Tuna Trips Out of Clarks Landing

          <Card.Text>
            The boat will be sailing out of Clarks Landing in Point Pleasant,
            NJ. Our offshore canyon trips are amazing experiences for anglers of
            all levels. During these trips, we primarily target tuna, whether
            itâ€™s bluefins, yellowfins, or big eyes. When the tuna fishing is
            slow, we enjoy targeting many other species that our canyons have to
            offer, such as mahi-mahi, tilefish, rose fish, barrel fish, sharks,
            and so much more. In addition to targeting these fish, mammals such
            as whales, dolphins, sea turtles, and many other sea creatures are
            common sights to see.
